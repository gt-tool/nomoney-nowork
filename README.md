# No Money, No Work

## reason

### ITFrancis

> I found a social phenomenon, that is, in developing countries, many enterprises do not pay overtime wages, but these enterprises still do not lack workers. At the beginning, I didn't understand why this happened. After observation and reflection, I found that it was mainly because people were too competitive: when an employee could not accept the life of overtime but no salary, and proposed to resign, the enterprise didn't care. Instead, it recruited new workers to replace the vacant Posts after resignation. It was very easy to recruit new workers, which led to more unscrupulous exploitation of workers by enterprise managers.
>
> Therefore, I would like to make an initiative: if your boss does not pay overtime wages, or the wages paid are far less than your pay, please stop working, even if it's just stopping overtime.
>
> I believe that the more people follow this initiative, the more you will gain from your efforts. So I implore you, for you, for your family, for your offspring, No Money, No Work.
